accesskey
=========

An accesskey is an access credential for identification when using TensorBay to operate on your dataset.

To obtain an accesskey, log in to `Graviti AI Service(GAS)`_ and
visit the `developer page <https://gas.graviti.cn/tensorbay/developer>`_ to create one.

.. _graviti ai service(gas): https://www.graviti.cn/tensorBay

For the usage of accesskey via Tensorbay SDK or CLI,
please see :ref:`SDK authorization <quick_start/getting_started_with_tensorbay:Authorize a Client Instance>`
or :ref:`CLI configration <tensorbay_cli/getting_started_with_cli:Configuration>`.

branch
======

Similar to git, a branch is a lightweight pointer to one of the commits.

Currently, TensorBay only supports a single branch, which is the default "main" branch.

Every time a :ref:`reference/glossary:commit` is submitted,
the main branch pointer moves forward automatically to the latest commit.

commit
======

Similar with Git, a commit is a version of a dataset,
which contains the changes compared with the former commit.

Each commit has a unique commit ID, which is a uuid in a 36-byte hexadecimal string.
A certain commit of a dataset can be accessed by passing the corresponding commit ID
or other forms of :ref:`reference/glossary:revision`.

A commit is readable, but is not writable.
Thus, only read operations such as getting catalog, files and labels are allowed.
To change a dataset, please create a new commit.
See :ref:`reference/glossary:draft` for details.

On the other hand,
"commit" also represents the action to save the changes inside a :ref:`reference/glossary:draft` into a commit.

continuity
==========

Continuity is a characteristic to describe the data within a :ref:`reference/glossary:dataset` or a :ref:`reference/glossary:fusion dataset`.

A dataset is continuous means the data in each segment of the dataset is collected over a continuous period of time
and the collection order is indicated by the data paths or frame indexes.

The continuity can be set in :ref:`reference/dataset_structure:notes`.

Only continuous datasets can have :ref:`reference/glossary:tracking` labels.

dataloader
==========

A function that can organize files within a formatted folder
into a :class:`~tensorbay.dataset.dataset.Dataset` instance
or a :class:`~tensorbay.dataset.dataset.FusionDataset` instance.

The only input of the function should be a str indicating the path to the folder containing the dataset,
and the return value should be the loaded :class:`~tensorbay.dataset.dataset.Dataset`
or :class:`~tensorbay.dataset.dataset.FusionDataset` instance.

Here are some dataloader examples of datasets with different label types and continuity(:numref:`Table. %s <dataloaders_table>`).

.. note::

  The name of the dataloader function is a unique indentification of the dataset.
  It is in upper camel case and is generally obtained by removing special characters from the dataset name.

  Take `Dogs vs Cats`_ dataset as an example,
  the name of its dataloader function is :meth:`~tensorbay.opendataset.DogsVsCats.loader.DogsVsCats`.

  .. _dogs vs cats: https://gas.graviti.cn/dataset/data-decorators/DogsVsCats

See more dataloader examples in :ref:`api/opendataset/opendataset_module:tensorbay.opendataset`.

dataset
=======

A uniform dataset format defined by TensorBay,
which only contains one type of data collected from one sensor or without sensor information.
According to the time continuity of data inside the dataset, a dataset can be a discontinuous dataset or a continuous dataset.
:ref:`Notes <reference/dataset_structure:notes>` can be used to specify whether a dataset is continuous.

The corresponding class of dataset is :class:`~tensorbay.dataset.dataset.Dataset`.

See :ref:`reference/dataset_structure:Dataset Structure` for more details.

draft
=====

Similar with Git, a draft is a workspace in which changing the dataset is allowed.

A draft is created based on a :ref:`reference/glossary:commit`,
and the changes inside it will be made into a commit.

There are scenarios when modifications of a dataset are required,
such as correcting errors, enlarging dataset, adding more types of labels, etc.
Under these circumstances, create a draft, edit the dataset and commit the draft.

fusion dataset
==============

A uniform dataset format defined by Tensorbay,
which contains data collected from multiple sensors.

According to the time continuity of data inside the dataset, a fusion dataset can be a discontinuous fusion dataset or a continuous fusion dataset.
:ref:`Notes <reference/dataset_structure:notes>` can be used to specify whether a fusion dataset is continuous.

The corresponding class of fusion dataset is :class:`~tensorbay.dataset.dataset.FusionDataset`.

See :ref:`advanced_features/fusion_dataset/fusion_dataset_structure:Fusion Dataset Structure` for more details.

revision
========

Similar to Git, a revision is a reference to a single :ref:`reference/glossary:commit`.
And many methods in TensorBay SDK take revision as an argument.

Currently, a revision can be in the following forms:

1. A full :ref:`reference/glossary:commit` ID.
2. A :ref:`reference/glossary:tag`.
3. A :ref:`reference/glossary:branch`.

tag
===

TensorBay SDK has the ability to tag the specific :ref:`reference/glossary:commit` in a dataset's history
as being important. Typically, people use this functionality to mark release points (v1.0, v2.0 and so on).

TBRN
====

TBRN is the abbreviation for TensorBay Resource Name, which represents the data or a collection of data stored in TensorBay uniquely.

Note that TBRN is only used in :ref:`CLI<tensorbay_cli/getting_started_with_cli:Getting Started with CLI>`.

TBRN begins with ``tb:``, followed by the dataset name, the segment name and the file name.

The following is the general format for TBRN:

.. code::

    tb:[dataset_name]:[segment_name]://[remote_path]

Suppose there is an image ``000000.jpg`` under the default segment of a dataset named ``example``,
then the TBRN of this image should be:

.. code::

    tb:example:://000000.jpg

.. note::

   Default segment is defined as ``""`` (empty string).

tracking
========

Tracking is a characteristic to describe the labels within a :ref:`reference/glossary:dataset` or a :ref:`reference/glossary:fusion dataset`.

The labels of a dataset are tracking means the labels contain tracking information, such as tracking ID, which is used for tracking tasks.

Tracking characteristic is stored in :ref:`reference/dataset_structure:catalog`,
please see :ref:`reference/label_format:Label Format` for more details.
